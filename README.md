# TapeLangauge
A basic programming language on a tape

This project was inspired by an assignment for the Spring 2018 Programming Languages assignment at Williams College using a trivial language called Breph. The language has been modified here. The language operates very simply with a data array, like a Turing Machine tape, and a simple set of commands:

| Command   | Action                                   | 
|:---------:| ---------------------------------------- | 
| p         | Print whatever the data pointer is over  |
| l         | Move the data pointer left one position  |
| r         | Move the data pointer right one position |
